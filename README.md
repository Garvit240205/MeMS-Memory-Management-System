The code manages memory in a hierarchical structure, where a main chain (linked list of nodes) contains sub-chains (linked list of segments) representing process (allocated) and hole (free) segments. The code keeps track of mappings between MeMS virtual and physical addresses in the mappings array. It is important to note that the code is designed to work on a specific platform or system with certain assumptions about page size (PAGE_SIZE) and system-specific features. The code uses mmap for memory allocation and deallocation. Additionally, the mappings array is used to maintain the MeMS virtual-to-physical address mapping.

mems_mapping Structure: This structure is used to store mappings between MeMS virtual addresses and physical addresses.

Node Structure: Represents a node in the main chain of memory segments.
Contains information about the allocated memory region, such as the start and end addresses, the number of pages, the size, and a reference to a sub-chain of segments.

ChainNode Structure: Represents a node in a sub-chain of memory segments (PROCESS or HOLE).
Contains information about a specific memory segment, such as the start and end addresses, size, and type.

mappings Array: An array of mems_mapping structures used to store MeMS virtual-to-physical address mappings.
The mappings_count variable keeps track of the number of mappings.

node_allocate: A pointer used to allocate nodes and chain nodes within a page.

head: A pointer to the head of the main chain.

arr Array: An array used to store pointers to allocated pages when needed.

indexing: An index variable used to keep track of the current page being allocated.

check: A variable to keep track of the amount of space allocated within a page.

These are the main functions in the code: 

mems_init():
This function initializes the MeMS system.
It opens the /dev/zero device file, which provides null-terminated strings, for memory allocation.
It uses mmap to allocate an initial block of memory (of size PAGE_SIZE) to be used as the head of the free list.


mems_finish():
This function is called at the end of the MeMS system to release all allocated memory.
It iterates through the linked list of allocated memory blocks (nodes) and uses munmap to deallocate them.
It also deallocates any additional memory blocks created using mmap and stored in the arr array.


mems_malloc(size_t size):
This function allocates memory of the specified size.
It first checks if the free list (head) is empty. If it's empty, it allocates a new block of memory using mmap.
The allocated memory is divided into nodes, where each node represents a block of memory with its size and type (process or hole).
If a block of memory in the free list is large enough to satisfy the request, it is used to allocate memory. If not, additional memory is allocated using mmap, and the excess memory is added to the free list as a hole.
The function returns the MeMS virtual address for the allocated memory.


mems_print_stats():
This function prints statistics about the MeMS system, including:
The number of pages used by the MeMS system.
The amount of memory that is unused, i.e., the memory in the free list (holes).
Details about the main chain (nodes) and sub-chains (process or hole segments) within the main chain.
It calculates and prints information such as total pages used, space unused, main chain length, and sub-chain lengths.


mems_get(void* v_ptr):
This function takes a MeMS virtual address (v_ptr) and returns the corresponding MeMS physical address.
It searches through the mappings array to find the physical address that matches the virtual address.


mems_free(void* v_ptr):
This function frees the memory pointed to by the given MeMS virtual address.
It locates the corresponding node and segment (process or hole) in the memory structure and marks it as a hole. If adjacent segments are also holes, they are merged into a single hole.
If the entire node is freed and its child (sub-chain) is empty, it is removed from the main chain.
